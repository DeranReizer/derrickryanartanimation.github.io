Derrick is a graduate from the University of Utah with a bachelors degree in Film and Media Arts with the Animation Emphasis and a Minor in Games.  He focuses on 3D Character animation and is currently enrolled in Animation Mentor to improve his skills.  He has experience in animating in different programs, including Maya, Blender and the Unreal Game Engine.  Derrick also creates Artwork and Storyboards using Adobe Photoshop and Krita for various projects to help create ideas for his personal projects.

Derrick has enjoyed animation for as long as he can remember.  Always looking to improve, he takes feedback on his work very seriously and is not afraid to ask questions for clarification.  He recently got into digital art during college and works on new pieces when he isn't animating.  

Derrick helped create two small games during his time at college; [_Augment!_](https://kaeyde.itch.io/augment) and [_Pull the Lever_](https://theultimatesir.itch.io/pull-the-lever), both of which he was in charge of the animation, texturing and modeling of characters and NPCs.  He has since improved his skills in animating.  He is currently working on two more game projects; _Escape the Manor_, a solo project, and _Professor Longtie_, with his father.

Derrick is currently seeking a position in animation as a junior or entry level animator where he can bring stunning characters to life and provide potential employers good quality animations.
